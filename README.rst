Comparing Drosophila gene transcript expression in different stages of development.


Description
===========

FlyBase is an free online bioinformatics database and the primary repository of genetic and molecular data for Drosophilidae insect family. All data is available to access and includes mutant phenotypes, molecular characterization of mutant alleles, cytological maps, wild-type expression patterns, anatomical images, transgenic constructs and insertions, sequence-level gene models and molecular classification of gene product functions. This project is focused on parsing through the gene expression files and plotting the data in order to provide improved data visualization of expression levels under different stages of development and in different tissues. 

Current models of data visualization extracted from the FlyBase website
